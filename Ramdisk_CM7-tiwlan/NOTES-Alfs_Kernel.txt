####ZCACHE####
"Dynamic compression of swap pages and clean pagecache pages"
Zcache doubles RAM efficiency while providing a significant performance 
boosts on many workloads. Zcache uses lzo1x compression and an in-kernel 
implementation of transcendent memory to store clean page cache pages
and swap in RAM, providing a noticeable reduction in disk I/O.


####fsync_disabled####
Export a new parameter in sysfs:

echo 1 > /sys/module/sync/parameters/fsync_disabled

Writing 1 to this file disable all the per-file sync capabilities:
fsync(), fdatasync(), sync_file_range(); writing 0 re-enables them.

WARNING: disabling fsync may cause loss of data if application crashes
in unsafe ways! Use it only if you know what you're doing.

This has two side-effects: making software that writes data safely to
disk via fsync(), fdatasync() or sync_file_range() a lot quicker and
battery safe, but also making the software no longer crash safe.

Filesystem buffers will be flushed all at once by the kernel or by
calling the sync() syscall (that is still enabled).


#########Basic KSM Support########

Enable Kernel Samepage Merging: KSM periodically scans those areas
of an application's address space that an app has advised may be
mergeable.  When it finds pages of identical content, it replaces
the many instances by a single resident page with that content, so
saving memory until one or another app needs to modify the content.
Recommended for use with KVM, or with other duplicative applications.
KSM is inactive until a program has madvised that an area is MADV_MERGEABLE,
and root has set /sys/kernel/mm/ksm/run to 1

Be sure to add '#define MADV_MERGEABLE 12' to
bionic/libc/include/sys/mman.h so we can have a central place for this

These then can be used by the kernel KSM module to re-join (copy on write)
pages between the various dalvik processes.

As is on a fully loaded system you can expect ~12MB to be indicated to be
scanned by KSM.. of this 10-15% will be saved; as such a recommend a very
slow scan until as any logic to stop scanning while sleeping will require
another process and remove all memory savings provided by this logic.

To activate on a KSM kernel (2min for full scan of ~16m and 1%CPU):
echo 1 > /sys/kernel/mm/ksm/run

Note, not all gingerbread roms support this.
